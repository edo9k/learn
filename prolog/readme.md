This code comes from the Tutorials Point section on Prolog.

# How to run the code

I used `GNU Prolog` to follow the tutorials. At the time of writing, version 1.4.5 is available in the debian/ubuntu apt registry.

You can either run from inside the Prolog REPL, or create a binary from yout source file. 

## Via Repl

```
$> prolog     # enter the repl
[filename].   % load the "database" (= program in prolog-land)
```


## Via Compiled Program

``` 
gplc filename.pl  # compile 
./filename        # run 
```
