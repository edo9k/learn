# Idris

These are the examples files created while reading the "Idris Tutorial" doc. 

The tutorial is located here: http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/

Which contains not only a walkthrough, but also instructions on how to set the compiler up, write and run programs. And also Dependent Typed programs, which (apparently) is the main driver behind Idris.
