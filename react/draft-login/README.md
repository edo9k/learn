# Draft for Login Task

- Boilerplated created with create-react-app (which is bloated AF, but I still need to figure out Webpack to able to ditch it).
- Uses GraphQL (via the Apollo client)
- Hooks, because less text
- One screen with a login form.
- Another login with user details in case of login success.
