# AWK language tutorial

I decided to do some AWK tutorials after watching a bunch of talks featuring
the guys from Bell Labs, Brian Kerninghan, who was one of the creators of AWK
together with Alfred Aho and Petter Weinberger. Apparently AWK comes from their
last name initals put together. 

I'm following the Tutorials Point tutorial on AWK.
