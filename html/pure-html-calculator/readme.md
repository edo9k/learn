### Calculator "Project" (Cursed HTML edition)

Another very stupid idea: creating a caculator in HTML, that does not use any Javascript.

Certanly, you could use a form, make the page send the request for a server, have the server process the simple calculations, and display the results for the user. 

That's not what this is about. This is more like a "multiplication table", but having the operation for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, for all one digit numbers (0..9). Have that statically written in the HMTL page, and with some poor quality CSS present in the way to mimic a calculator. With zero Javascript. 

Yes, it's a stupid idea. 

Yes, I need other hobbies.

Yes, I'm writing this crap like someone is going to read this.
