# Erlang Tutorial

From the Tutorials Point collection:

Erlang can be installed via package manager (like apt).

To load programs you need to enter the Erlangs REPL with `erl`, and load modules with the `c(module_name).` command. 

Words that start with lowercase are recognized as atoms, and variables star with an Uppercase letter. I think these are the same converntions from Prolog. Erlang seems to be heavily inspired in Prolog ideas.
